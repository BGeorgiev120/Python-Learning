# Phython Lists

## What is lists?
- The lists are something like veriables that store multiple data that you can acces spesific one.
- The list are usable for codding more then one elemet that you can use. Example: When server collects clients he is not going to store them in multiple variables,but only in *one*.
And there is the **List**

## Syntax
```python

example_list = ["banana", "apple", "orange"]
print(example_list[0])
print(example_list[1])
print(example_list[2])

```
This is one way to register and use the list.
### Here is an exaplanation of the code
So we need to create veriable that is storing these list.
Then with square brackets `[]`  we type the data that we want to save.
```python
example_list = ["string", veriable, 1] 
```
#### Then we need to print the value of the list
```python
print(example_list)
```
But if you want to print only one data saved you can do it by specifing with square brackets ``[]``

#### âš  The data sorting starts with 0. So the first data that is saved is number 0.

```python
print(example_list[0])
```
Output:
```output
banana
```
