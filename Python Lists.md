# Python Lists

## What are lists?
- Lists are something like variables that store multiple data items that you can access specifically.
- Lists are useful for coding with more than one element that you can use. 

  Example: When a server collects clients, it is not going to store them in multiple variables, but only in one.
And there is the **List**

## Syntax
```python
example_list = ["banana", "apple", "orange"]
print(example_list[0])
print(example_list[1])
print(example_list[2])
```
#### âš  The data indexing starts with ``0``. So the first data that is printed is number ``0``.
This is one way to register and use the list.
### Here is an explanation of the code
So we need to create a variable that is storing these list items.
Then with square brackets `[]` we type the data that we want to save.
```python
example_list = ["string", variable, 1] 
```
#### Then we need to print the values of the list
```python
print(example_list)
```
But if you want to print only one saved data item, you can do it by specifying with square brackets ``[]``

```python
print(example_list[0])
```
Output:
```output
banana
```
