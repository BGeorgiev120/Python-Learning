# In this cenario we use white to repeat some messages. This can be used for everything!
# Make sure you have the correct sytax or the code will be broken.
i = 10
while i > 0:
    print(f"The number {i} is bigger then 0")
    i -= 1
    
# In this scenario we have While that makes whenever 'i' is bigger then 0 to make it smaller by one!
# While can check,repeat and do more things. You just need to have imagination.
